           A God to Pharaoh
          &#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/h1&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;

    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      
           “And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet” Exodus 7:1
          &#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      
           Moses went into Pharaoh who rebuffed him and despised the Lord that sent him:
          &#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      
           “. . . .Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go” Exodus 5:2
          &#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      
           Little did Moses realize he was confronting the powers and gods of Egypt for the release of Israel from their bondage of four hundred and thirty years. Pharaoh, the world power of their time, refused to let go whilst hardening his heart against every appeal. Pharaoh raised opposition through the magician of Egypt as well as invoking their gods against Moses and the elders of Israel.
          &#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      
           It became necessary for God to intervene at the cry of Moses. God demonstrated His Lordship to the world superpower by making Moses a god to Pharaoh. Men naturally serve, reverence and hold a god in high esteem. Men equally consult the gods to receive instructions to know what to do for both the present and future. The word of the gods is usually final. By implication, both Pharaoh and his magicians had to bow and reverence the man-god Moses who was no longer an ordinary man. Little wonder they cried out as Moses operated as a god: “. . . How long shall this man be a snare unto us?. . . Egypt is destroyed. . .“ (Exodus 10:7)
          &#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      
           Confrontations, challenges, distractions from authorities, powers, home-front, marriages, workplace, ministry etc can constitute a type of pharaoh. But God is about to make you a god to whatever would constitute itself as a roadblock in your assignment this year if only you can cry to him like Moses did (Exodus 6:30). Daniel became a god to the authorities in Babylon and Persia, with testimonies of him possessing the spirit of the holy gods (Daniel 4:8,9). Kings practically worshiped him in reverence of his God (Daniel 2:46) and those who despised him paid dearly for it. Mordecai and Israel became untouchable to their predator, Haman who despised the man made a god did so to his own peril. He was hanged on the very gallows he made for the purpose of executing “god-Mordecai”.

    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      
           This season, the Lord will make you a god to your situations and circumstances of life to showcase His Lordship to your world.
          &#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      
           TODAY, if you will believe God for your situation and allow Him to demonstrate His Lordship through you, He will make you a god to whatever issue of life that may be confronting you. Those situation will bow before your God and you will be a god-man.
          &#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

           The Philistines assembled against Israel with great intimidation of size and number and as expected, they were all fearful, except Prophet Samuel. The prophet engaged a none conventional weapon of war, he offered an unusual sacrifice to God: “And Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. Then Samuel cried out to the LORD for Israel, and the LORD answered him” (1Samuel 7:9). The heavens opened and thundered against opposition to confuse the Philistines and Israel defeated them.
          &#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      
           Prophet Samuel saw the awesome manifestation of God and with a grateful heart sets up a stone and called it Ebenezer which implies “Thus far the LORD has helped us.”
          &#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      
           Beloved, a thousand had fallen on your side and tens of thousand on your right side and you are still standing. You are a living witness of how death has dealt its blow on mankind, terminating the lives of many, yet you are still standing! It has pleased our Sovereign God; perfect and just in all His ways to allow some to be called to glory but He has chosen to preserve your life. Those who have been called to glory in Christ have been welcomed into the bosom of our Lord and Saviour.
          &#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      
           You, however, joined the millions who cried upward to heaven for divine intervention over your life, family and nation and here you are, strong and healthy. Evidently it is time to set up your “stone of God’s help” and with a grateful heart to declare to all and sundry that “Thus far the LORD has helped us.”!
          &#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      
           And the scripture said “So the Philistines were subdued, and they did not come anymore into the territory of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.” God’s help translates to permanent victory when we learn to set up “stones of his help” to acknowledge his gracious manifestations in our lives.
          &#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      
           TODAY, be that grateful soul who recognizes the mighty deliverance God has wrought in his life and set up your “stone” with a heart lifted up and a cry of EBENEZER to him who has done you well.

           The darkest moment of the day is said to be the midnight, the point at which a new day begins to dawn. Coincidentally, that is the time most people tend to enjoy their sleep and would frown at any disturbance that may interfere with their cherished sleep and rest. However, this is the same hour that has been earmarked in the timetable of God for the arrival of the bridegroom, the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
          &#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      
           Fortunately for the church, there will be a midnight cry to wake us up from our slumber and to stay awake to receive the groom: no man is allowed to welcome the groom whilst sleeping. The call is clear and distinct: “Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning” (Lk.12:35) why?
          &#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      
           The midnight is an hour of complete spiritual unconsciousness, of inability to maintain a clear departure from worldliness, of spiritual insensitivity and lack of clear sight. It is an hour when spiritual thieves are quite rampant and dispossessing us of our spiritual values and pursuit if we are careless. The master’s instruction is “gird the loins of your heart. . “ 1Pet.1:13, that is tighten up to prevent the devil from polluting you with ungodly alternatives that now trade for God’s will. Tighten up against excesses; “and take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares." Lk.21:34. Materialism has practically overtaken us and this is nothing but an indication of the midnight hour: gird your heart!
          &#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      
           Your light must be blazing, the outward manifestation of the inward grace, the presence of Jesus Christ, evidenced by your good works that is never tainted with flesh nor ungodly motive. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. (Mt.5:16). Your light is not your eloquent speech, skills or charisma but outstanding and uncompromising godly character that showcase Christ. It must be so evident to vex the unrighteous in your community.
          &#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;span&gt;&#xD;
        
            ﻿
           &#xD;
      &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;span style="display: initial;"&gt;&#xD;
      
           Oh that TODAY the child of God will discern that we are inching towards the midnight hour and the cry is blaring through many unusual events of our time (COVID-19, general unrest etc). It is time to refuel with the oil of the Spirit to keep the flame burning!
