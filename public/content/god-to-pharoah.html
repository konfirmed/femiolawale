                "And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet" - Exodus 7:1
            </div>
            <div class="blog-text">
                Moses went into Pharaoh who rebuffed him and despised the Lord that sent him:
            </div>
            <div class="blog-text">
            “. . . .Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let
            Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel
            go” Exodus 5:2
        </div>
        <div class="blog-text">
            Little did Moses realize he was confronting the powers and
            gods of Egypt for the release of Israel from their bondage
            of four hundred and thirty years. Pharaoh, the world power
            of their time, refused to let go whilst hardening his heart
            against every appeal. Pharaoh raised opposition through the
            magician of Egypt as well as invoking their gods against
            Moses and the elders of Israel.

        <div class="blog-text">
            It became necessary for God to intervene at the cry of
            Moses. God demonstrated His Lordship to the world superpower
            by making Moses a god to Pharaoh. Men naturally serve,
            reverence and hold a god in high esteem. Men equally consult
            the gods to receive instructions to know what to do for both
            the present and future. The word of the gods is usually
            final. By implication, both Pharaoh and his magicians had to
            bow and reverence the man-god Moses who was no longer an
            ordinary man. Little wonder they cried out as Moses operated
            as a god: “. . . How long shall this man be a snare unto
            us?. . . Egypt is destroyed. . .“ (Exodus 10:7)

            Confrontations, challenges, distractions from authorities,
            powers, home-front, marriages, workplace, ministry etc can
            constitute a type of pharaoh. But God is about to make you a
            god to whatever would constitute itself as a roadblock in
            your assignment this year if only you can cry to him like
            Moses did (Exodus 6:30). Daniel became a god to the
            authorities in Babylon and Persia, with testimonies of him
            possessing the spirit of the holy gods (Daniel 4:8,9). Kings
            practically worshiped him in reverence of his God (Daniel
            2:46) and those who despised him paid dearly for it.
            Mordecai and Israel became untouchable to their predator,
            Haman who despised the man made a god did so to his own
            peril. He was hanged on the very gallows he made for the
            purpose of executing “god-Mordecai”.

            This season, the Lord will make you a god to your situations
            and circumstances of life to showcase His Lordship to your
            world.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-text">
            TODAY, if you will believe God for your situation and allow
            Him to demonstrate His Lordship through you, He will make
            you a god to whatever issue of life that may be confronting
            you. Those situation will bow before your God and you will
            be a god-man.
